# state-machine-diagram-inference

This program recognizes state diagrams using ChatGPT and automatically generates the source code stub as well as the test code.

Please see [infer-edges-and-generate-test-code](infer-edges-and-generate-test-code), where the main code resides, for installation and how to run it.

In addition, if you want to anonymize your graphs before sending them to ChatGPT, we provide the tool to scramble the diagram labels in [text-scrambling](text-scrambling).
